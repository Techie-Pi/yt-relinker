# YouTube ReLinker

Right now, YouTube uses an unnecessary, custom and slow redirection service where they could just... use the URL.

This extension replaces the URLs of this redirection service with the original URLs without making any requests!

## Installation

1. Download the latest ``.xpi`` from the releases page
2. Go to ``about:addons`` and drop the ``.xpi`` file

## Development

Install ``web-ext``

### Build

Run ``web-ext build``
